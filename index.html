<!-- I have always liked to explore, and I figured a biography/captains log that is somewhat related to space exploration would be a good theme. I also am interested in a space exploration game called EVE ONLINE,
so keeping the theme related to a critically acclaimed space flight game can be a good mix for my first website -->

<h3>Graduated at the Space Exploration Institute of Technology 'SEIT'</h3>
<!-- This is based off U of T, but making up a school enabled a futuristic, high tech setting -->
<p class="para1">"This school is located deep within the heart of the City of Toronto. As a child I discovered a Sun Dial located near the south end of the school. 
The look of it gave me inspiration to look at the sky and see what is beyond the clouds. I would walk amongst the school grounds where astronomers would discuss ancient civilizations that were discovered in outer space!
I knew of ruins here on Prima Terra, and how some civilizations haven't even managed to colonize Mars, even the Moon for that matter. But what of the civilizations that have already set out to explore
the unknown?"</p>

<p class="para1"> "With this is mind, I want to see what it was that can bring to ruin a civilization great enough to traverse the stars. 
By studying at SEIT, I learned robotics and data/computer science that allowed me the skillset to find the ruins of these civilizations and learned what had happened to them."

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p class="para1">"Following my inspiration from my school, I was bound to send robotic drones with the latest remote sensing technology to gauge the geography of these civilizations through the ruins that they left behind.
That being said, I went to develop my skills at NASA piloting robotic drones off in distant planets. During training at work, I thought it would be funny to have my robot take a selfie pouring itself tea using a kettle and teacup
in my instructors house. The satellites locating my robot pinpointed its location on the map."

<!--This setting in Sudan is based off a story I read in National Geographic -->
<!--ImageOption End-->
<p class="para1"> "Following my training from NASA, I was sent to work on my first project! Unfortunately, my first project didn't involve going to the Andromeda Galaxy, or to be on board with a crew of 
swashbuckling space marines. The work involved some damage control for some relics and ruins located on Prima Terra. I was to send my drones in conducting some remote sensing after rumors were spread that a Grazmorph
was smuggled into Sudan from one of the moons of Jupiter. Apparently, this monster broke free from the smugglers and ran rampant and angry towards the Pyramids of Meroe located in Sudan. People in the country were afraid that their
ancient ruins, which was a source of tourism for people who visited the country, were having their history destroyed. I was to help locate this monster and evaluate the amount of damage done to the pyramids."

  <div class="desc1">A Grazmorph causing havoc on a pyramid</div>
</div>
<!--ImageOption End-->
<p class="para1">"I lost a couple of my drones and the budget for my project took a hit, and one of the pyramids got destroyed in the process. But I was successful in not only locating the Grazmorph, but veered it away from the other pyramids, protecting them.
Afterwards, I got orders from NASA to locate the smugglers that brought the Grazmorph in Sudan on Prima Terra to begin with. 
It was difficult considering how well their operations are run. But my drones are impeccable, and I had no issues locating their bases which were near the pyramids themselves! 
No wonder the Grazmorph was so close to the pyramids when it was it was set loose!"
</p>
<p class="para1">"Once the locations were found, I worked in tandem with Prima Terra Military to smoke these smugglers out. I've never considered myself a man of combat, but the use of robotic drones caught the eye of the world military.
It seems my remote sensing and probing skills along with my remote controlling of drones is a huge boon military wise. And I was grouped in with the intelligence division to find these smugglers and bring them to justice!
I still have the map that had the locations of these smuggler hideouts. In the end, the smugglers were taken out, and the pyramids were kept intact."

<h3>Finally Exploring Space</h3>
<p class="para1">"After my success with the space faring smugglers destroying important historical ruins on Prima Terra, NASA was impressed with my efforts and offered me work exploring space station ruins within the Oort Cloud.
More importantly, the Prima Terra Military worked in partnership with NASA, and so I had a chance of piloting military drones for combat that were using covert ops grade cloaking devices, along with my drones for remote sensing."
</p>
<p class="para1">"I was confused for the military to step in, I didn't see how a threat can be present as I am hacking space stations that contain data or relics based on what I pick up with my remote sensing. They explained
to me that pirate factions are commonplace on space ruins situated upon large astroids within the Oort Cloud. Not to mention, the relics and data that I recover can amount to millions of isk, and pirates usually ransack drones carrying 
valuable scavenged items. So having cloaked drones armed to the teeth can scare them off well away, unless their ordnance exceeds that of my drones."
</p>
<p class="para1">"The choice that changed the trajectory for the rest of my career was when the Military and NASA asked if I was comfortable and willing to pilot a ship to go out into space with a military escort!
I was ecstatic! I said absolutely! Training began almost immediately, where I would develop my piloting skills with not just drones, but SPACESHIPS AS WELL! I was brought to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and begun training
using modules and ships developed and branded by the Sisters of EVE, an institution that specializes in wormhole space exploration and finding ruins for relic and data sites."

<h2>Pilot to Fleet Commander</h2>
<p class="para1">My path that began recovering ruins from Prima Terra to a spacefaring explorer is something that can rival the path of Captain Kirk himself! From the Kennedy Space Center to the Oort cloud, my accomplishments then began
to accumulate from there. Here are but a few accomplishments that I have made:
</p>
<h3>Cosmic Anomalies</h3>
<hr>
<div class="a">
  <div>- Scanned down anomalies of cosmic signatures finding sites of pirate factions including the Angel Cartel, Guristas Pirates and the Serpentis Corporation that have rogue drones which pose a threat to other explorers</div>
  <div>- Scanned down anomalies of relic and data sites that belong to aformentioned pirate factions, which resulted in hacking into there ruined stations and retrieving millions of isk from data or modules retrieved</div>
  <div>- Commandeered multitudes of drones including Gallente and Amarr drones</div>
  <div>- Uncovered Covert Research Facilities known as 'Ghost Sites', where numerous forgotten high-tech civilizations once existed, including the Sleepers, the Takmahl, the Talocan and even the Triglavians</div>
</div>
<h3>Faction Warfare</h3>
<hr>
<div class="a">
  <div>- Took part in faction warfare siding with the Sisters of EVE during wormhole exploration and recovering relic and data sites from enemy pirate factions, using Sisters of EVE ships such as the Astero, Stratios and Nestor models</div>
  <div>- Took on contracts with the Gallenteans and Amaarians for exploring certain wormhole space and clearing combat sites of pirate factions so expeditions may proceed for the respective empires</div>
  <div>- Recruited into a fleet for massive wormhole expeditiions under contract for the Sisters of EVE, Gallenteans, Amarrians and the Vereor Nox Empire</div>
</div>
<hr>
<!-- Vereor Nox is latin for 'fear the night', which I found strangely cool for an empire in space, always in perpetual night -->
<h3>Vereor Nox Fleet Commander</h3>
<hr>
<div class="a">
  <div>- While under contract for the Vereor Nox, I was given an oppurtunity to commandeer a starting, small fleet for wormhole expeditions where piracte faction bases may have established themselves in wormhole space</div>
  <div>- They allowed me to hire my own crew for my fleet and I used Sisters of EVE modules and ships for the loadouts I had for them</div>
  <div>- I am now currently the Fleet Commander for the Vereor Nox with some of the best exploration ships around to conduct expeditions for lost civilizations out in space</div>
</div>
<hr>
<h2>My Current Fleet Loadout</h2>
<hr>
<h3>In this <a href="file:///D:/ProgramFiles/GISSchoolWork/GEOM101/Assignment%202/ArmyFleetLoadout.html" target="_blank">Table</a> shows the loadout of my fleet, including the ships used, their respective loadouts, and the amount of ships there are.</h3>
<hr>
<h2>Ships of my Fleet<h2>
<h3>The reasoning behind choosing the ships of my fleet is largely due to previous experience in working with the Sisters of EVE prior to my Fleet Commander Role. Each ship suits a particular task:</h3>
<hr>
<!-- I don't even play EVE ONLINE, but their websites are really cool to navigate and their model designs for ships are really cool as well -->
<!--LinksOption Begin-->
<h3><a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Astero" target="_blank">Astero</a></h3>
<!--LinksOption End-->
<p class="para1">The Astero plays a vital role in being invisible to enemies while scouting for ruins to explore and has a tried and true drone bay for self-defense if threatened. One of the best exploration frigates</p>
<hr>
<!--LinksOption Begin-->
<h3><a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Stratios" target="_blank">Stratios</a></h3>
<!--LinksOption End-->
<p class="para1">The Stratios is a great cruiser for playing the rescuer, which acts as support for the the Asteros that may run into danger</p>
<hr>
<!--LinksOption Begin-->
<h3><a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Nestor" target="_blank">Nestor</a></h3>
<!--LinksOption End-->
<p class="para1">My own personal ship that oversees the fleet and our operations. It containts the largest drone bay should I need to rescue my fleet mates. It is currently one of the best ships for exploration purposes</p>
<hr>
<h2>Future Endeavors<h2>
<h3 class="para1">"I have greatly enjoyed massive success within my career trajectory. My gratitude is immense, and my job has kept me on my toes and engaged in my work as I explore wormhole space and contend with rival pirate space factions.
Like everyone else, I am curious for what my future holds, but its the unknown that inspires me. For that reason, I am comfortable knowing that I don't know, for that's the condition required for further exploration!"<p>
