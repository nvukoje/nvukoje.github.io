<!-- I have always liked to explore, and I figured a biography/captains log that is somewhat related to space exploration would be a good theme. I also am interested in a space exploration game called EVE ONLINE,
so keeping the theme related to a critically acclaimed space flight game can be a good mix for my first website -->
